# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of the analysis
The goal of this project was to determine list of retiring employees in the next few years for hypothetical company, Pewlett Hackard 
and the positions (and titles) that the company needs to fill. 

## Results:

The first step to was to create a list of names of retiring employees by joining the employees and titles tables 
filtering them by date of birth and removing duplicates. Basis this list, there are 90,398 employees retiring that company needs to plan for.



A list of unique titles was made and then the count of retiring employee for each title was calcuated.




It is noted that Senior Engineer, Senior Staff and Engineer's hold the largest share (23.9%) of employees likely preparing for retirement.


The next step was to determine the employees that qualified for mentorship, and only 1549 total employees were found to be
qualify for mentorship/training for an internal promotion.



## Summary
Based on the findings of my analysis Pewlett Hackard is potentially facing over 90,398 vacant positions soon out of whoch only 1549 i.e. 1.7% can be filled internally.
So the company has to draw up plans for external hires accordingly.
